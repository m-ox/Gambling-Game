# Gambling-Game
A Textual Adventure

The plot starts where presumable Liam Lynch in his 2002 single, United States of Whatever, originally was throwing dice.
A creepy man waves you over to play a simple gambling game with him.

He offers the chance to double your money, as long as you roll higher than him. That sounds all well and fine,
but there is way to up the ante. By choosing to bet a finger that odds are in your favour, you can make ten times the winnings.

You can only gamble five fingers and you start with 10 credits.
